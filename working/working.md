Scripts should run with this as the working directory. We recommend you do the same thing locally to avoid mixing output files with source files.

So for example run a script like so:

`python ../src/measurement_locations.py`

Then any outputs such as the submission file, or graphical representations, will end up here.

If you wrap your python pipeline in bash scripts, this may be a good place to keep them.
